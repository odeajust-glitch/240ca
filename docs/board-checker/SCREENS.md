# CATS screen guide

How to read CATS, as taught by the owner (a working crew member). This is
the source of truth for the screen map and parser in `lib/board/`. When the
owner explains something new about a screen, it goes here first, then into code.

Mechanics (from the Phase 0 probe; see HANDOFF "Phase 0 findings"):
- Each screen is drawn in frame `jacadaframe`. Every mainframe field is an
  absolutely-positioned element, so a row = fields sharing the same top offset,
  and a column = a left offset.
- Keys: PF keys are buttons `acc_F1`…`acc_F24`. Typed fields are inputs
  `txt_Sub0802501055_<n>`.
- Read the screen like a person: drive the page, never replay raw POSTs
  (`sequenceNumber` changes every screen).

## How we capture screens
Run `node scripts/board-probe.js`, sign in, step through CATS in the usual
order, then press Enter. `summary.json` → `screens[]` has, per screen: step
number, `cameFrom` (key pressed and masked text typed), and `screenGrid` (rows
as `top | left:text | …`, names and employee numbers masked; codes, times and
train/turn symbols kept). The owner adds what each screen means.

## Getting to the board
_(Owner: steps from the first screen after sign-in to the board. What you
type, in which box, and which key you press.)_

1. …

## Board screen: _(name as shown on screen)_

Header / prompt line seen: `(9=AAAA, 9-9=AAAA, A=AAAA)` _(owner: what are the
options?)_

### Columns, left to right
Positions (x, px) to be filled in from the masked `screenGrid` of the next probe run.

| # | Heading on screen | Example (masked) | Meaning | x |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | | `AA99` | | |
| 2 | | `9` | | |
| 3 | | `999` | | |
| 4 | EMPLOYEE NAME? | `NAME+` | Crew member's name. What does `+` mean? | |
| 5 | | `A` | | |
| 6 | | `AAAA` (e.g. REST) | | |
| 7 | | `A9` | | |
| 8 | | `AA` (e.g. CO) | | |
| 9 | | `AA` | | |

### Codes
| Column | Code | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| | REST | |
| | CO | |

### Paging
_(Owner: does the board run onto more than one page? Which key moves to the next
or previous page? "PREV" appears on screen.)_

## Other boards
_(Fast vs Slow spareboard, pools, availability lists. Is each one a separate
screen, or the same screen with a different selection?)_

## Reading a call / runaround
_(Owner: when someone is called, what changes on the screen? How would you spot
a runaround by looking at the board?)_
